# Entry 7(Presentation and Expo)

## Context 
After we finished our website we had to present it to our peers. We had to make slides explaining the process, takeaways, and showing our website. These are my [Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WvyUj_ZFR6HQCKmh9Ygeybpoeqc0MHMuGMDKVfbIDzU/edit#slide=id.p).

## Engineering Design Process
During this part of the poject I was at step 8 of the engineering design process, where the goal is to communicate the results. This part was more about showing your final result of your website to others.
## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **communication**, and **organization**
