# Entry 7(Presentation and Expo)
##### 6/2/24

## Context 
After we finished our website we had to present it to our peers. We had to make slides explaining the process, takeaways, and show our website. These are my [Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WvyUj_ZFR6HQCKmh9Ygeybpoeqc0MHMuGMDKVfbIDzU/edit#slide=id.p). I was very nervous before presenting but I felt better when I got up to present. Some takeaways I got from the presentations were to not be very nervous and be more confident. As I said when I got up o present I felt comfortable and felt proud of showing my hard work. Another takeaway is to have less information on the slide and just talk about the information so the audience feels like it's a conversation with them and not have to read everything in the slides. But I put more information on the slides because I was nervous and thought I wouldn't know what to talk about. Overall, I think my presentation went very well.

We also had an expo in which we all presented our work informally in the cafeteria in a "science fair"-type setting. These are Judges (past alumni) present to decide the finalists. For the expo, we had to prepare an elevator pitch, a short, persuasive speech that one gives to create interest in something. This is the link to my [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IudJ_O42K6LJtYqkUdPSPaq_1uvjqjVF056Qb5vOZXc/edit#heading=h.6o1f62qg6jz9) where I wrote my elevator pitch. A takeaway I got from the expo is that you don't have to stick to your elevator pitch you can also make the presentation more natural. Because my elevator pitch was a little long, I didn't stick with the elevator pitch completely.

This is the feedback I got from Mr. Muller:

## Engineering Design Process
During this part of the poject I was at step 8 of the engineering design process, where the goal is to communicate the results. This part was more about showing your final result of your website to others.
## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **communication**, and **organization**
### Communication
A skill I learned while working on this part of the project is communication because I had to present my website to my peers. I had to learn to be a better public speaker.
### Organization
Another skill I learned during this experience is organization. We had to make slides and an elevator pitch so I had to learn how to organized my ideas of what I woud say during the presentation and expo.
## Summary
To conclude, I am very happy and proud of my website andpresentation.
