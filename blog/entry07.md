# Entry 7(Presentation and Expo)
##### 6/2/24

## Context 
After we finished our website we had to present it to our peers. We had to make slides explaining the process, takeaways, and showing our website. These are my [Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WvyUj_ZFR6HQCKmh9Ygeybpoeqc0MHMuGMDKVfbIDzU/edit#slide=id.p). I was very nervous before presenting but when I got up to present I felt better. Some takeaways I got from the presentations were to not be very nervous and be more confident. Because as I said when I got up o present I felt comfortable and felt proud of showing my hardwork. Another takeaway is to have less information on the slide and just talk about the informaion so the audience feels like its a converstaion with them and not have to read everything in the slides. But I put more information on the slides because I was was nervous and thought I wouldn't know what to talk about.

## Engineering Design Process
During this part of the poject I was at step 8 of the engineering design process, where the goal is to communicate the results. This part was more about showing your final result of your website to others.
## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **communication**, and **organization**
