# Entry 2 (Software & Hardware on Interior Design)
##### 11/27/2023
## Context 
During this part of our year-long project, we had to search about the software and hardware on interior design. 

One of the main advantages of interior design software is the ability to visualize design ideas in 3D. This allows users to see exactly what their space will look like before any work is done, which can be useful when trying to visualize the final result of a renovation or redesign. The article ["12 of the best free home and interior design tools, apps and software"](https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/renovate/design/a28461218/best-free-home-interior-design-tools-apps-software/) shows many useful apps for interior design. For example, SketchUp, which is the most comprehensive free 3D design software. The free version is perfect for hobbyists, while the pro version is more suited to professionals in architecture, construction, engineering, and commercial interior design. 

Hardware on interior design made evolving from the times of hand-drafting large sheets possible. Architects in the present times use gadgets to make their work not only simple but also to enhance its quality. The article [10 must have gadgets for every architect](https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/architectural-community/a2797-10-must-have-gadgets-for-every-architect/) shows some of the most important gadgets. One of them is laser tape measure an alternative to a traditional tape measure that makes the process of measurement more convenient. 
A graphic tablet is a compact and portable device, which enables architects to sketch no matter where they are. 
And portable color digitizer allows one to pick a color from nature or built surfaces and later use it in their drawings. 
## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in steps 2 of the engineering design process, where the goal is to research softwares and hardwares on interior design. We did more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and did more research about the technology that is used in that career. The next step of the engineering design process is brainstorming possible solutions.
## Skills
Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **how to google, growth mindset,** and **time management**
### How to Google 
A skill I learned during this experience is How to Google. During my research about interior design software and hardware, there were many websites and some weren't what I was looking for. So I had to google different things to make it easier to find the best website. For example, for interior design software I had to search up "interior design apps". And for interior design hardware I had to search up “gadgets that interior designers use”.

### Growth Mindset
Another skill I learned was growth mindset. While I was searching up hardware for interior design no good websites was showing up. But I learned to be patient and continue searching. After I searched “gadgets that interior designers use” and websites that I wanted showed up. 

### Time Management
I have several commitments after school, such as student government once a week, theater, and being on the basketball team. And as the workload got busier, I needed to work on this project. I try to do my work as fast as I get home so I do not procrastinate. 

## Summary
 I am excited to continue working on this project. And our next step is to brainstorm possible solutions.
