##### 5/1/24
## Context
In this part of our year long project we had to create an mvp of our website, which is having a working websites. First, we had to make two wideframe one for mobil view and another for computer view.

## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in step 5 of the engineering design process, where the goal is to create a prototype. This part was more about vreating the MVP of our project. The next step of the engineering design process is to improve as needed.
## Skills 
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **debugging, problem decomposition,** and **time management**
### Debugging

### Problem Decomposition 

### Time Management
One skill I learned is time management, I had to follow a timeline to complete my MVP in time. I had to follow the tiemline since during spring break I was away for vacation and couldn't work on it as much so I had to have most of it done before break. 
## Summery 
So far I am very excided with the restult of my MVP. Our next step is to go above the MVP.
