# Entry 6 (Completing MVP)
##### 5/1/24
## Context
In this part of our year long project we had to create an mvp of our website, which is having a working websites. First, we had to make two wideframe one for mobil view and another for computer view. Then we had to make a plan of what components, colors, fonts we were using and a timeline of when we are completing each thing. This helped me a lot while working on the mvp by having everything ready and knowing if I was behind or not. It helped me understand the importance of a plan. To make this websites I used a navbar, a carousel,containers/grids/ columns, and jQuery. While building the websites I encountered many challanges, for example 

## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in step 5 of the engineering design process, where the goal is to create a prototype. This part was more about vreating the MVP of our project. The next step of the engineering design process is to improve as needed.

## Skills 
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **debugging, problem decomposition,** and **time management**

### Debugging
A skill I learned was debugging since they were many errors while coding my MVP. For example, I couldn't get the jQuery slide to work and when I got the to work by changing their id, my CSS wasn't working. And I figured out that I had forgotten to change the id in the CSS too.

### Problem Decomposition 
Another skill I learned was problem decomposition because while trying to create a carousel I couldn't get the carousel to have text inside it. So I have to break down the problem and try different ways. However, I ended up finding how to make it work from W3Schools. 

### Time Management
One skill I learned is time management, I had to follow a timeline to complete my MVP in time. I had to follow the tiemline since during spring break I was away for vacation and couldn't work on it as much so I had to have most of it done before break. 

## Summery 
So far I am very excited with the restult of my MVP. Our next step is to go above the MVP.
