# Entry 6 (Completing MVP)
##### 5/1/24
## Context
In this part of our year long project we had to create an mvp of our website, which is having a working websites. First, we had to make two wideframe one for mobil view and another for computer view. Then we had to make a plan of what components, colors, fonts we were using and a timeline of when we are completing each thing. This helped me a lot while working on the mvp by having everything ready and knowing if I was behind or not.
