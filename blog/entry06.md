# Entry 6 (Completing MVP)
##### 5/1/24
## Context
In this part of our year-long project, we had to create an MVP of our website, which is having a working website. First, we had to make two wireframes one for mobile view and another for computer view. Then we had to make a plan of what components, colors, and fonts we were using and a timeline of when we are completing each thing. This helped me a lot while working on the MVP by having everything ready and knowing if I needed to catch up. It helped me understand the importance of a plan. I used a navbar, a carousel, containers/grids/ columns, and jQuery to make this website.

While building the websites I encountered many challenges, for example, I couldn't get the carousel to have text inside. I tried many different ways but it couldn't work. Then, I found a carousel with text in W3Schools which helped me build mine. This is the code I had to do for the carousel to work with text:

```
<div id="myCarousel" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
            <!-- Indicators -->
            <ol class="carousel-indicators">
              <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
              <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="1"></li>
              <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="2"></li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Wrapper for slides -->
            <div class="carousel-inner">
              <div class="item active">
                <img src="design.webp" alt="Los Angeles" style="width:100%; height: 700px;">
                <div class="carousel-caption">
                  <h1>Interior Design</h1>
                  <h4>Learn more about the future of interior design</h4>
                </div>
              </div>

              <div class="item">
                <img src="img.jpg" alt="Chicago" style="width:100%; height: 700px;">
                <div class="carousel-caption">
                  <h1>Interior Design</h1>
                  <h4>Learn more about the future of interior design</h4>
                </div>
              </div>

              <div class="item">
                <img src="img2.jpg" alt="New york" style="width:100%;  height: 700px;">
                <div class="carousel-caption">
                  <h1>Interior Design</h1>
                  <h4>Learn more about the future of interior design</h4>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Left and right controls -->
            <a class="left carousel-control" href="#myCarousel" data-slide="prev">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>
              <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
            </a>
            <a class="right carousel-control" href="#myCarousel" data-slide="next">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span>
              <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
            </a>
          </div>
        </div>
```

Another challenge I faced was getting two jQuery slides to work side by side. In the beginning, it didn't work but I had to change the ids for it to work. This is the code I used in the head of the code:

```
 <script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
       $("#flip1").click(function(){
        $("#panel1").slideToggle("slow");
      });
      $("#flip2").click(function(){
         $("#panel2").slideToggle("slow");
       });
    });
    </script>
```
And this is my code in the body of html:
```
 <div class="contanier">
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                  <div id="flip1">Consumer software</div>
                  <div id="panel1">
                    <ul>
                      <li>info</li>
                     </ul>
                </div>
              </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                  <div id="flip2">Consumer hardware</div>
                  <div id="panel2">
                     <ul>
                      <li>info</li>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
```
## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in step 5 of the engineering design process, where the goal is to create a prototype. This part was more about creating the MVP of our project. The next step of the engineering design process is to improve as needed.

## Skills 
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **debugging, problem decomposition,** and **time management**

### Debugging
A skill I learned was debugging since there were many errors while coding my MVP. For example, I couldn't get the jQuery slide to work and when I got them to work by changing their id, my CSS wasn't working. I figured out that I had forgotten to change the id in the CSS too.

### Problem Decomposition 
Another skill I learned was problem decomposition because while trying to create a carousel I couldn't get the carousel to have text inside it. So I have to break down the problem and try different ways. However, I ended up finding how to make it work from W3Schools. 

### Time Management
One skill I learned is time management, I had to follow a timeline to complete my MVP in time. I had to follow the timeline since during spring break I was away for vacation and couldn't work on it as much so I had to have most of it done before break. 

## Summery 
So far I am very excited about the result of my MVP. Our next step is to go above the MVP by adding more components and fixing possible errors.
