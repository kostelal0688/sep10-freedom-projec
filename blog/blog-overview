## Context 
The The Freedom Project is a course-long project where you apply the content you are learning in daily lessons to your own creation, learn new content on your own, 
reflect upon your learning in a blog, and present your product and process.

and link you to the websites of the furniture. This blog will show some of positive & negative impact on society that these technologies will have.
