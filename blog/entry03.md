# Entry 3 (Content & Future of Interior Design)
##### 12/18/23
## Context 
In this part of our year-long project, we had to brainstorm new ideas for the future of our field and finalize all of your content so that it's ready for the website. Website content is any text, or image on a website.

For new technologies for the future in interior design, I researched and found more about AI and virtual reality. The article, ["Four Ways Technology Is Boosting Interior Design Internally and Externally"](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/innovation/guest-article/boosting-interior-design-internally-and-externally/) shows how AI in interior design is the potential to make the design process more efficient and cost-effective. And virtual reality will reshape the future of 3D interior design, taking it to a whole new level. Designers can walk their clients through all the living spaces they’ve created, enabling them to feel the interiors. However, when we got advice from our peers, they told me that I needed to create something new. Lizmarie told me about the idea of an app that while you design your house and furniture you can see the price of everything and it takes you to the website where to buy the furniture. Which I liked because it makes it easier for people to find things they want and that they can afford.

In addition, to finalize the content of the website I combined all the work I did on parts A and B of the project. I also got inspiration from my peers in the years before. For example, [this project](https://alanl0566.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/#Context) helped me put my content together. 

## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in step 3 of the engineering design process, where the goal is to brainstorm possible solutions for the future. This part was more about our ideas for possible tech inventions in the future. The next step of the engineering design process is to plan the most promising solution.
## Skills
Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **creativity,** and **consideration**
### Creativity
One skill I learned during this experience is being creative. To create new technologies for the future you need creativity. Without being creative I would have not been able to brainstorm about new technologies like the app that while you design your house and furniture you could see the price of everything and it takes you to the website where to buy the furniture.
### Consideration
Another skill I learned while working on this part of the project is consideration. New technology is meant to make people's lives easier. So I had to consider what possible technology could make interior design easier and how it will impact people. And solve possible problems in the field. 
## Summary
To conclude, I am excited to continue working on this project. My next step is to plan the most promising solution.
