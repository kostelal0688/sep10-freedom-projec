# Entry 4 (Choosing a Tool)
##### 2/12/24
## Context 
During this part of our year-long project, we had to tinker and research many different tools so we could choose the one we most liked. The tool that I have chosen to use for the project is jQuery. I was also considering other tools like Aframe or Jekyll but I chose jQuery because I was more comfortable while tinkering with it. 

I tinkered with jQuery by using tutorials and trying to code in my ide. To tinker with my tool I followed the tutorial on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquERy/default.asp), I read a lot of information about jQuery and tried the "try it yourself" examples.

In addition, to understand more about jQuery I used the [jQuery repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery?tab=readme-ov-file). I cloned the repo into my ide and followed the README.md to build my own jQuery. After I cd into the directory I had to use `npm install` and `npm run build` to install dependencies, and run the build script. Then, to build all variants of jQuery, I had to run the following command `npm run build:all`. I continued to tinker by using different commands. Here is a picture of my jQuery folders in my ide:
