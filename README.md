# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Kostela Lila**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Interior Design**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **jQuery** in order to help me make by website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Improved personalization: AI can help designers create more personalized designs for their clients. By analyzing data about the client’s needs, preferences, and lifestyle, AI-powered tools can generate design ideas that are tailored to the individual – presuming, of course, that the right data is presented.
* Greater creativity: AI could help designers to generate design ideas and possibilities. For example, AI can be used to generate design options that would be difficult or impractical to create manually, or may simply have not been considered. An interior designer could quickly explore mood boards that might otherwise take a long time to assemble. This could lead to more innovative and creative designs.
* Reduced costs: AI can help to reduce the cost of interior design services. By automating tasks and streamlining the design process, AI could make interior design more affordable to a wider range of clients.
* Saves Time 

##### CONS
* Technical issues
* Inaccuracies
* Increased dependence on technology
* Lack of creativity: While AI can be a valuable tool for generating design ideas, it is important to remember that AI can never be a replacement for human creativity. AI-generated designs can sometimes be unoriginal or derivative – AI thrives on collective information from what has come before, making originality impossible. It is important for designers to carefully review and edit AI-generated designs to ensure that they are unique and reflect the client’s vision.
* Bias: AI algorithms are trained on data, and if that data is biased, the AI will be biased as well. This means that AI-generated designs could potentially reflect the biases of the data they were trained on. The very function of AI is to collect new information and add it to existing information to grow results. This can be a huge resource if you want to know what is trending or fashionable, but equally just as big a blocker for anything innovative.
* Loss of control: When designers use AI to create designs, they may feel like they are losing control over the design process. This is because AI algorithms are complex and can be difficult to understand. It is important for designers to understand how the AI tools they are using work, so that they can maintain control over the design process.
* Lack of emotion: The feeling of a design, the preferences of a client and connectivity of a space to its surroundings are almost impossible to program into AI. Trained interior designers will use knowledge of architecture, design, art, furniture, history and even sociology to create rooms that deliberately foster an emotional response based on more than dimensions and current trends.
* Reduce work for Interior Deginers
