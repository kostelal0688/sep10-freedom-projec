                        <li>AI for Interior Designers</li>
                           <ul>
                            <li>AI cannot replace Interior Designers as a whole as the process is personal and creative, so human connection and interaction is a must. However, AI can serve as a helping hand to interior designers. AI will push creative boundaries, providing unmatched personalization and efficiency.
                            </li>
                            <li>One of the main benefits of AI in interior design is the potential to make the design process more efficient and cost-effective.</li>
                            <li>As technology continues to evolve, it is expected that AI-powered interior design tools will become even more advanced and user-friendly. Some potential developments include:</li>

                        <ul>
                          <li>VR is reshaping the future of 3D interior design, taking it to a whole new level. Designers can now walk their clients through all the living spaces they’ve created, enabling them to really feel the interiors. They can get a clear sense of scale, and even test out numerous designs on their own with a simple tap of a button.
                          </li>
                          <li>VR is not yet fully accessible to the public, as it’s still expensive, but that’s where AR comes in. Augmented Reality enables interior designers to blend the virtual and real worlds by overlaying virtual elements on top of physical features.
                          </li>
                          <li>VR will take over completely in the near future but, until then, interior experts can rely on AR to create outstanding designs.</li>

                        <li>Smart Homes</li>
                        <ul>
